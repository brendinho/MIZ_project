Meeting with Seyed for the regression projeect

stick to mR


calculate the start of the first and second waves for all of canada (instead of by-province)


calculate the start of the first wave in the middle of the straight line of the semilog plot - could be the start of July

first wave - until 31 Jul 2020
second wave - 1 Aug 2020 - 22 Feb 2021
third wave - 23 Feb 2021 - end of Jun 2021

fourth wave (don't include the fourth wave, since this is ongoing)

timelines of intervention to justify the breakpoints, though Seyed doesn't think they're hard to justify in the draft of the paper

justify by lowest 7-day moving average within a window of 100 days

let's not dso the provinces yet

conclusion: overall the parameters were significant, but in different waves they varied in significance (and relative importance)

connect them to interventions used during different waves

F0 - significant proportion of the population, many working, therefore commute, many also retired that were warned about the disease

we need to link to risk factors and implemented interventions (qualitativelyhave a discussion on that)

would it be better to break it by number of whether it's couple or single:
    F0 - household without children
    Fs - any single parent household
    Fc - households with couples
    
    reorganise by lumping health region based on their score instead of all Canada, rather than provinces

    scale parameters so that they're all the same order of magnitude
    
    try these for Ontario and Canada (should still be okay for canada)
    
    F0/(F0+F3+F4)
    
    F3/(F0+F3+F4) - percentage of household
    
    F4/(F0+F3+F4)
    
    scale D to everything, log(D) try that instead (usually people put log(population size))
    
    jack up the mR by some number \

    mixed_effects model ???
    
    focus on canada for how
    
    wrap the paper for CMAJ open - look at the entire canada
    \ dumpo the tables into appendix
    
    Table 1 in appendix
    
    colorBRewer - something that 
    
    Figure 1(a) - extend the y-axis to see where the bar ends, second axis for population density of emtire provine/territory
    Figure 1(b) - colorBrewer, diverging, 7 classes, colorblindsafe, either the first or the last pallette for the choropleth
    	Not given, None, Weak, Moderate, strong, etc
    	
    Figure 2 - off completely - we're not talking about Ontario etc
    Figure 3: actual Canada data as a grey bar chart, and superimpose 7-day moving average (like New York Times), shade each wave wih different colours, x ticks on a 45 angle, and display every month, don't show the dividng dates between the waves
    
    Table 2: gone
    
    insert the table with the regression variables 
    
    chill on the Toronto stuff - we'll get back to that later
    
    	** DO NOT USE THE SAME COLORU SCHEME FOR THE TWO SUBFIGURES - IT'S MISLEADING
