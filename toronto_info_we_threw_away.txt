############# ABSTRACT

escriptive and regression analysis carried out on an infection line list for the City of Toronto shows that mean COVID-19 reporting delay (in days) differed among genders, age cohorts and resident neighbourhoods (Kruskal-Wallis $H$ test, $p$-values $<0.01$). Odds of hospitalisation (given infection), and ICU admission (given hospitalisation) were found to be higher for older individuals than those of the baseline cohort ($\le19$ yrs). Odds also varied by neighbourhood, though no proxy for `remoteness' was used. Males were also more likely than females to be hospitalised and intubated upon infection, while reporting delay significantly affected neither. Significant higher odds ratios of both hospitalisation and ICU admission in the second wave of infection point to increased virulence of COVID-19 variants.

############ INTRODUCTION

Logistic regression analysis was conducted on line list data for the city of Toronto to find the impact of age, sex, neighbourhood of residence and wave on the probabilities of hospitalisation and ICU admission.

############ METHODOLOGY

\subsection*{Neighbourhoods in the Toronto reporting region}

Forward sortation areas (FSAs) are small geographical areas defined by the first 3 characters of six-digit Canadian postal codes (used for mail sorting and delivery). For the Toronto metropolitan area, a neighbourhood- and FSA-level COVID-19 line list giving demographic and case severity information was obtained from the City of Torontoâ€™s OpenData portal. Data was stratified by age group ($\le19$, $20-29$, $30-39$, ..., $80-89$, $\ge90$), sex (male, female, transgender, non-binary, etc.), neighbourhood (140 total), source of infection (travel, community, close contact, etc.), FSA (997 total) and case classification (confirmed and probable). The start of the second wave of infections in this list was derived from that of the entire province of Ontario. Since the data set lists both episode and reporting dates for each case (as well as case classification), only confirmed cases with a reporting delay of between 0 and 60 days were taken. This information was supplemented by the corresponding numbers of testing and vaccination centres in each neighbourhood, as well as 2016 census demographic information stratified by neighbourhood (City of Toronto Open Data and the \emph{cancensus} package \cite{bergmann2021cancensus}, corresponding FSA designations not given).

############ RESULTS

\subsection*{Analysis of Toronto case incidence and rates of hospitalisation and ICU admission}

\subsubsection*{Time to report}

We defined the reporting delay as the number of days between the start of the episode and the day of reporting; we used only data relating to confirmed cases with reporting delays between 0 and 60 days. Figure~\ref{fig:toronto:reporting_delay_distribution} shows the overall delay distribution with maximum-likelihood negative exponential (rate $\lambda=0.236353\pm0.000585$) and Weibull (shape $\beta=1.250428\pm0.002223$, scale $\eta=4.713005\pm0.010033$) distribution fits.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Reporting delays in the City of Toronto.}
\end{figure}
Using the Kruskal-Wallis $H$ test, we found that age (both waves, $p<\num{2.2e-16}$), sex (first wave, $p=0.001643$; second wave $p=\num{1.479e-06}$) and neighbourhood (both waves, $p<\num{2.2e-16}$) influenced time from symptom onset to reporting. Specifically, case reporting delays were lower during the first wave than the second. \note{This may be due to risk compensation (i.e., not being so afraid of leaving the house to go to the clinic to get tested, the appearance of testing popups and more centres in general, maybe there was some element of stigma)}. There was no great variation of the average reporting delay between age bands, though there was more variation among gender categories.

We used two logistic regression models; the first calculates the odds of hospitalisation across different ages, sexes and waves of infection as
\begin{dmath} \label{eqn:first_toronto_logit_model}
    \textrm{Log-odds}(\textrm{hospitalisation | infection})=\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^8\beta_i(\textrm{age, group})+\beta_9(\textrm{sex, male})+\beta_{10}(\textrm{sex, other})+\beta_{11}(\textrm{wave})+\beta_{12}(\textrm{mean reporting delay}),
\end{dmath}
where the age-groups are successive $10$-year age bands (20-29 years, 30-39 years, ..., 80-89 years, 90 and older), and sexes recorded in the data are aggregated into three categories(male, female and other) \note{was this well stated?}. The youth demographic (0-19 years), the first wave and the female sex were used as baselines for the odds ratios.

    \label{tab:toronto_logit:hospitalisation}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:toronto_logit:hospitalisation} shows that age, sex and wave influenced the probability of hospitalisation (given infection) in the City of Toronto. Compared to the $\le19$-year demographic, the odds of hospitalisation increase with age (until the final $\ge90$-year cohort), with an 80-89 year old being roughly 101 times more likely to require hospitalisation than the baseline. Males were also more likely to be hospitalised than females (OR 1.459), while neither sex nor reporting delay had an impact. Hospitalisation upon infection was also more probable in the second wave of infection than the first, \note{perhaps a reflection of the increased virulence of variants.}

The second model calculates the odds of ICU admission given hospitalisation for all the demographic categories listed above, so that
\begin{dmath}
    \textrm{Log-odds}(\textrm{ICU admission | hospitalisation})=\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^8\beta_i(\textrm{age, group})+\beta_9(\textrm{sex, male})+\beta_{10}(\textrm{sex, other})+\beta_{11}(\textrm{wave})+\beta_{12}(\textrm{mean reporting delay}).
\end{dmath}

Here, we found that that the chances of ICU admission (given hospitalisation due to COVID-19 infection) was higher among older demographics than in the youngest cohort (0-19 years), while non-females were more likely to be admitted to the hospital than females (ORs male 1.85, other 1.182). The change of ICU admission was also higher in the second wave of infection (OR 1.336), \note{also pointing to the increased virulence of COVID-19 variants}. Reporting delay also slightly influenced the change of ICU admission (OR 1.017), with a small positive correlation between reporting delay and ICU admission during illness ($r=0.0086$).

We repeated regression \eqref{eqn:first_toronto_logit_model}, with neighbourhoods included, so that we get the model 
\begin{dmath} \label{eqn:first_toronto_logit_model_nbd}
    \textrm{Log-odds}(\textrm{hospitalisation | infection})=\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^8\beta_i(\textrm{age, group})+\beta_9(\textrm{sex, male})+\beta_{10}(\textrm{sex, other})+\beta_{11}(\textrm{wave})+\beta_{12}(\textrm{mean reporting delay})+\sum_{i=13}^{152}\beta_i(N_{i-13}),
\end{dmath}
where the $N_i$ are enumerated Toronto neighbourhoods. A choropleth map depicting the spatial distribution of the resulting odds ratios (with reference to neighbourhood $N_1=\textrm{West Humber-Clairville}$) is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:toronto_choros:odds}, while Fig.~\ref{fig:toronto_choros:cases} shows the distribution of case reports throughout the city. The overall number of case reports by neighbourhood and the corresponding ORs are nearly uncorrelated ($r=0.0968342$)

################ DISCUSSION

Comparatively, the logistic regressions proposed for the City of Toronto (based on the line list data available to the authors) performed well, showing that age cohort, sex and wave all impacted the probability of hospitalisation and ICU admission in the event of laboratory-conformed COVID-19 infection. With Kruskal-Wallis $H$ testing, we were able to confirm that the mean reporting delay differed between sexes and age cohorts, and also between waves, with all delays being smaller in the second wave of infection than in the first. This may be due to expanded testing capacity, the availability of (and therefore greater access to) testing locations or possibly lower risk-aversion (that is, being more likely to leave the house and interact with others though not strictly necessary. As expected, odds of hospitalisation were higher for older persons than younger ones, with males larger odds of both hospitalisation and ICU admission upon infection; this echoes other literature putting men at greater risk of serious illness and mortality \cite{peckham2020male, jun2021analysis, nguyen2021male}. We also found systematic differences in odds rations among neighbourhoods. \note{Seyed: see the model in the below comment that sort of works for the odds ratios. given that I trashed the census information for being out of date, do you think that I can justify doing a linear regression on the odds ratios of neighbourhoods using the same 2016 census information?} We posit that our proposed models for the City of Toronto were more successful than the previous models featuring remoteness was the currency of the data; none of the covariates were drawn from external sources, especially 2016 census information.
